The Bullet Journal Method,Ryder Carroll,Male,2018,Portfolio(Penguin),Nonfiction,Thrift Store,Physical,320,3,I picked this up from the thrift store for a couple bucks expecting a generic self-help book. It is for the most part exactly that but it is very well put together one.This was also at a time when I was trying to use my notebooks more after trying and failing to get a  journaling habit to stick and I'll credit this book with finally getting me journaling on a consistent basis.

The Courage to Be Disliked,"Ichiro Kishimi,Fumitake Koga","Male,Male",2018,Atria Books(Simon & Schuster),Nonfiction,Other,Ebook,288,3,"I definitely don't need courage to be disliked, that just happens organically. This book is way more ""self-helpish"" than I anticipated but not directly at first. It is also the first book I've read that uses Socratic dialogue and that alone kept me engaged. I'd like to read more books written in that manner."
Black Food,Bryant Terry,Male,2021,4 Color Books,Nonfiction,Library,Physical,320,4,"A compendium of stories, recipes, and artwork from black chefs, writers, and artist of all different backgrounds. I'm taking a point off because the title author only has like 2 recipes and his recipes were the ones I was most looking forward to."
In Praise of Shadows,Junichiro Tanizaki,Male,1977,Leete's Island Books,Nonfiction,Library,Ebook,56,3,"If you can get beyond the very 1970s racism and misogyny, there are interesting ideas about design and the role shadows play in it. There is also a very long rant about the poor design of bathrooms and toilets that makes me almost forget the racism. Almost, but not quite."
Atomic Habits,James Clear,Male,2018,Avery(Penguin),Nonfiction,Library,Physical,320,2,Maybe my expectations were high because this has been recommended to me 1000 times but I do not believe this book is good. It is very actionable so if you need that then great but that's where the positives end.

Conveinence Store Woman,Sayaka Murata,Female,2018,Grove Press(Grove Atlantic),Fiction,Amazon,Ebook,176,4,Dark comedy is very much in my wheelhouse. A story about a conveinence store worker who doesn't understand social cues and is (probably) on the spectrum finds herself in unfortunate life situations because while her job has an employee operating manual; her life outside of work does not.
California Soul,"Keith Corbin, Kevin Alexander","Male, Male",2022,Random House,Nonfiction,Amazon,Ebook,320,5,"A memoir about the author's life dealing with gangs, crime, and Southern California. Boyz in the hood but absolutely not a movie. This is a story I can relate to this, but only loosely. I've seen some of the things he's seen, but only from afar. It's a different perspective of someone in a situation I thought I knew more about and something about that stirs an uneasy feeling in me that I can't quite explain. For now, I'll just put these feelings in that box with the rest of them. I'm sure I'll get around to unpacking it sooner or later."
Drawing on the RIght Side of the Brain,Betty Edwards ,Female,2012,TarcherPerigee(Penguin),Nonfiction,Amazon,Physical,320,4,"Despite being rife with pseudoscience about the brain, the results can't be denied. My drawing ability before and after this book is night and day."
